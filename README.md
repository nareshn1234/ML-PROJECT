**Dataset Description:**

* The dataset consists of the following columns:

* Disease: The name of the disease.

* Count of Disease Occurrence: The frequency of disease occurrence.

* Symptom: The symptoms associated with the disease.

**Usage**

* Ensure all dependencies are installed.

* Load the dataset and preprocess it.

* Train the models and evaluate their performance.

* Use the trained models to predict diseases based on input symptoms.

**Results & Analysis**

The performance of each algorithm has been evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results provide a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of each model in predicting diseases.
